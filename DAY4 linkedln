Day 4 Complete! #CrackYourInternship #CrackYourPlacement Challenge

I'm thrilled to share that I've successfully completed Day 4 of the #CrackYourInternship and #CrackYourPlacement Challenge inspired by @Arsh. Today, I focused on honing my skills by solving these diverse and challenging problems:

    Gas Station: https://leetcode.com/problems/gas-station/solutions/5496075/eazy-solution-detailed-solution-upvote-please/
    Minimum Deletions to Make Character Frequencies Unique: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-deletions-to-make-character-frequencies-unique/solutions/5495934/freq-count-eazy-solution-detailed-solution/
    Remove K Digits: https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-k-digits/solutions/5495762/easy-greedy-missing-the-last-case-the-special-case/
    Restore the Array from Adjacent Pairs: https://leetcode.com/problems/restore-the-array-from-adjacent-pairs/solutions/5496558/easy-believe-your-instincts-upvote-please/
    Task Scheduler: https://leetcode.com/problems/task-scheduler/solutions/5496057/greedy-approach-detailed-solution-upvote-please/
    Problem of the Day: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-good-leaf-nodes-pairs/solutions/5495619/hard-solution-not-easy-to-tackle-for-me/

These challenges pushed me to apply my understanding of algorithms and data structures effectively. Each problem taught me valuable lessons in optimization and problem-solving strategies.

I've been diligently tracking my progress in a dedicated GitHub repository to stay organized and motivated throughout this journey. Check out my progress and solutions here: GitHub Repository : (https://github.com/MITTALBHAVYA/45DaysDSAChallenge)

I'm excited about the skills I'm building and can't wait to tackle more challenges ahead. Let's keep pushing forward and crack those interviews! ðŸ’¼ðŸ’ª
