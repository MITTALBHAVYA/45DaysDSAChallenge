**Day 2 Complete! #CrackYourInternship #CrackYourPlacement Challenge** 
I'm excited to share that I've successfully completed Day 1 of the #CrackYourInternship and #CrackYourPlacement Challenge inspired by #ReviseWithArsh. It's a great start towards my journey of mastering DSA and preparing for my dream internship. ðŸ’ª

Here are the problems I tackled today:
1. [Range Sum Query - Immutable](https://leetcode.com/problems/range-sum-query-immutable/solutions/5479803/easy-segment-tree-solution-detailed-explanation/)
2. [Range Sum Query - Mutable](https://leetcode.com/problems/range-sum-query-mutable/solutions/5479942/easy-solution-based-on-range-sum-query-immutable-detailed-explanation-o-nlogn/)
3. [Count of Smaller Numbers After Self](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-of-smaller-numbers-after-self/solutions/5480200/policy-based-data-structure-easy-solution-ordered-set-red-black-treee/)
4. [Count of Range Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-of-range-sum/solutions/5480342/policy-based-data-structure-easy-solution-detailed-solution/)
5. [PROBLEM OF THE DAY](https://leetcode.com/problems/create-binary-tree-from-descriptions/solutions/5479572/very-easy-solution-o-n-easy-to-understand-detailed-explanation/)

ðŸ“ˆ These problems have challenged me to think critically and improve my problem-solving skills, especially in Segment Trees. 

I am maintaining my progress in a dedicated GitHub repository to track my journey and keep myself accountable. Stay tuned for more updates!
